## What is Defitrack?

Defitrack is a set of SDKS, smart contracts and graphs that contribute to a defi aggregation API. It's a fully open source API that lets you easily integrate DeFi in wallets and applications without having to know the specific underlying domain of the protocols and chains.

We've only been building Defitrack for a few months now, creating a robust architecture to quickly help you find your investments. We're adding new platforms and networks on a daily basis. However, in the near future, our main focus will be:

* Map Lending, Borrowing, Pooling and Farming markets
* Find the best lending opportunities

# What is Defitrack?

## A Brief Summary

Defitrack is the gateway to decentralized finance. It attempts to unify web3 protocols by abstracting common principles and domains.

It consists of a set of SDKS, smart contracts and graphs that contribute to a defi aggregation API. It's a fully open source API that lets you easily integrate DeFi in wallets and applications without having to know the specific underlying domain of the protocols and chains.&#x20;

It unifies all concepts of lending, borrowing, vaults, farming and staking to easy to integrate elements.

### Supported Protocols

We support a variety of different protocols, some partially and some fully.&#x20;

## What are we currently focusing on?

We've only been building Defitrack to create a robust architecture to quickly help 3d parties integrate with defi protocols. We're adding new platforms and networks on a daily basis. However, in the near future, our main focus will be:

* Map Lending, Borrowing, Pooling and Farming markets
* Abstract integration with markets, so you can invest principal and claim rewards using a unified API.
* Find the best lending/farming opportunities based on the underlying tokens.
* Find all opportunities based on your wallet
* Find better opportunities based on your current investments

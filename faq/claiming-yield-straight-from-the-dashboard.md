# Claiming yield straight from the dashboard

If you look up an account, it's possible that you spot **claimable rewards.** These rewards are a result from yield farming or liquidity mining.

In order to claim your yield, there are a few prerequisites however.&#x20;

## Web3

First of all, the dashboard will have to connect with your web3 wallet, like metamask or frame.sh. You'll need to enable to correct account too.&#x20;

## Network

Once you're logged in correctly, you'll see the details of your claimable rewards.

If you're not on the correct network to submit the transaction, the dashboard will complain.

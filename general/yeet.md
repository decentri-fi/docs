# üèâ Yeet

Defitrack Yeet allows you to invest in liquidity pools in one single transaction using just one token. By using Yeet, any arbitrary token can be used to invest in an LP.



### Approve the token

Before you can automatically let our smart contracts create LPs from your token, you'll have to approve the token to be used by our smart contract.

After approval, you'll be able to choose the amount you'd like to deposit.&#x20;

By clicking on your balance, you'll be able to yeet everything in.&#x20;

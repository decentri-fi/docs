# Uniswap API

🔍 **Uniswap Overview:** Uniswap is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to swap various ERC-20 tokens without the need for a traditional order book. Uniswap uses liquidity pools and smart contracts to facilitate trustless and permissionless token swaps.

💡 **How Uniswap Works:** Uniswap operates on a simple yet powerful mechanism. Users can trade tokens directly from their wallets through liquidity pools. These pools consist of pairs of tokens, and prices are determined algorithmically based on the ratio of tokens in the pool.

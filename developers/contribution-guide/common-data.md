# Common Data

We keep all the data our code relies on in a separate [github repository](https://github.com/defitrack/data). If you need to rely on external data: instead of pulling it straight from a third party server, we clone it in this repository.



Data can be but is not limited to:

* Tokenlists
* ABIs
* Logos
* Protocol-specific data (like pool lists etc...)
